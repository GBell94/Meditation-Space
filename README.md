# The Meditation Space

The Meditation Space is a simple one-page site for a fictitious independent teacher of transcendental meditation (TM) who currently offers online training courses and wants to attract individuals and groups who are intrested in meditation and in learning the technique.

Site visitors will be able learn more about TM, how easy it is to practice and some of the demonstrated benefits. They can also see how the course is structured, the time commitment and cost and are able to contact the teacher either by phone or email or can provide their details to find out more about upcoming dates. 

## Design

The colour scheme was chosen following recommendations in an article on the site [99 Designs](https://99designs.co.uk/blog/tips/website-color-schemes/) in order to create a calm but modern feel to the site but also to maximise readability and accessibility. The Oswald and Roboto sans serif fonts were also chosen to make the site easy to read and create a clean feel.

## Features

### Responsive design

Users may access the site on a range of device sizes, from mobile to desktop, and the design reflect this. Media queries ensure that the site remains easy to read and use on mobile. 

### Navigation

The navigation bar is fully responsive and includes links to each of the main sections of the page (About Us, Learn, Sign Up and Contact). This allows users to navigate quickly to their area of interest. Whilst a first time user might wish to scroll down the whole page, a returning user might wish to just visit one particular section, eg to remind themselves of the course structure, to sign up for more information or to find the teacher's contact details.

The image conveys the theme of the site and also indicates that it is possible to meditate anywhere, which is referred to in the About Us section. The tag line references the fact that a typical TM session is 20 minutes long and also that site visitors are most likely to be looking for a way to find a sense of calm in their lives but without needing a huge commitment of time.
